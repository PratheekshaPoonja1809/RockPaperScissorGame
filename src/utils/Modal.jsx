            Rock, Paper, Scissors is a quick and fun game played between two
            players - in this case, you vs the computer. The goal is to choose a
            hand gesture that beats your opponent's choice.

          <div>
            Get ready for a quick and classic face-off! <br />
            Choose your move - Rock, Paper or Scissors. The computer picks at
            the same time. The winner is decided by these rules:
            <ul className="game-rules">
              <li>
                Rock(
                <Image src={IMAGE_MAP.Rock} alt="Rock" />) crushes Scissors(<Image src={IMAGE_MAP.Scissor} alt="Scissor" />)
              </li>
              <li>
                Paper(<Image src={IMAGE_MAP.Paper} alt="Paper" />) covers Rock(<Image src={IMAGE_MAP.Rock} alt="Rock" />)
              </li>
              <li>
                Scissors(
                <Image src={IMAGE_MAP.Scissor} alt="Scissor" />) cut Paper(<Image src={IMAGE_MAP.Paper} alt="Paper" />)
              </li>
              <li>Same move? It's a tie</li>
            </ul>
            <em>Make your choiceâ€¦ and may the best pick win!</em>

            <h4>Best of N Matches Mode</h4>
            <p>
              In this mode, the player chooses how many matches to play -
              anywhere from 1 to 10.
              <br />
              After selecting the number: The player plays Rock Paper Scissors
              one round at a time. Each round shows who won (player, computer,
              or draw).
              <br />
              The game keeps track of scores for both sides. <br />
              Once all matches are finished, the game shows the final winner
              based on the total score. <br />
              <em>
                It's a fun way to play multiple rounds and see who comes out on
                top!
