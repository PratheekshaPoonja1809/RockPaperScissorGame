          Rock, Paper, Scissors is a quick and fun game played between two
          players - in this case, you vs the computer. The goal is to choose a
          hand gesture that beats your opponent's choice.

          Get ready for a quick and classic face-off! <br />
          Choose your move - Rock, Paper or Scissors. The computer picks at the
          same time. The winner is decided by these rules:
          <ul className="game-rules">
            <li className="flex-center">
              Rock(
              <Image src={IMAGE_MAP.Rock} alt="Rock" />) crushes Scissors(

            </li>
            <li className="flex-center">

          <h4>Best of N Matches Mode</h4>
          <p>
            In this mode, the player chooses how many matches to play - anywhere
            from 2 to 100.
            <br />
            After selecting the number: The player plays Rock Paper Scissors one
            round at a time. Each round shows who won (player, computer, or
            draw).
            <br />
            The game keeps track of scores for both sides. <br />
            Once all matches are finished, the game shows the final winner based
            on the total score. <br />
            <strong>

                It's a fun way to play multiple rounds and see who comes out on
